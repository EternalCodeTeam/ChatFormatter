# Contributing to ChatFormatter

:Wave: Hello there!
We wholeheartedly welcome all contributions to ChatFormatter and are excited to know you are considering making one.

To ensure a robust and ideal solution, we recommend going through this guide.
Following this guide saves both your time,
and some of our core contributors are engaged in maintaining the project and reviewing proposals.

## Submitting Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- Before submitting a bug report or a feature request, please ensure you've done a thorough search on
  our [Issues tab](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/Chatformatter/issues) to ensure it wasn't previously reported or
  requested.

- Our [issue template](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/Chatformatter/issues/new) is designed to guide you in
  submitting
  a detailed report, which helps us greatly in understanding, recreating, and addressing the issue.

- For feature proposals, kindly submit them under
  our [Issues tab](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/Chatformatter/issues)
  using the `feature` tag. Describe the feature, specifying why you think it is beneficial. It would be great if you
  could elaborate on its expected behavior.

## Building

1. Navigate to the project root directory (i.e., the directory where the repository is cloned).
2. Use Gradle to build the project by typing the following command on your command line:

```bash
gradle shadowAll
```

Your build should be successful, and you should see a JAR file in the `/build/libs` directory.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. For significant changes, open an issue for discussion before starting your work.

2. Fork the repository to your account.

3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chatformatter.git
   ```

4. Create a new branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b name-your-branch-here
   ```

5. Make the necessary changes/additions in the code.

6. Commit the changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add a detailed commit message here"
   ```

7. Push the code back to the repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin name-your-branch-here
   ```

8. Open a pull request (PR) against the `master` branch of our repository. Describe your changes, why you believe they
   are necessary, and how they improve the project. Additionally, reference any related issues.

9. Our maintainers will review your PR. We might suggest some changes, improvements or reasoning on why the changes
   should be/not being made.

Remember, to code reviews function as a quality control and learning opportunity.
Be receptive to the suggestions made
and committed to making the suggested improvements.
